# earthquake-prediction-system

Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict earthquake magnitudes based on historical seismic data. The system integrates data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and models like Random Forest, Linear Regression, and SVR. It features a Flask web application where users input parameters like latitude, longitude, and depth to get real-time earthquake magnitude predictions.

Technologies Used:
Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and scales features.
Machine Learning: Trains and evaluates multiple models.
Real-Time Predictions: Flask app for user input and prediction.
